			<h2>Splyt (96) - Crypto</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Bob splitted a secret and gave some pieces of it to some of his friends. We managed to convince Eve and Chris to give us their shares.</p>
			<p>We are given a tar <a href='/downloads/writeups/polictf/splyt.tar'>file</a> with the files implementing the split and join functions of the shares.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>This problem was an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme in Python. You could solve this problem without knowing that, though.</p>
			<p>There's a build.sh file with the commands that were run to generate this problem. After messing around with the code to try to make it work right, I realized that the flag was split into 20 parts, and 13 were needed to join it back together. We only have 3. I looked at the split functions, in __init__.py. The pick_coefficients function is only ran once, so there is only one random number generated from the split function, and it's reused in each of the shares.</p>
			<p>We did have numbers corresponding to the letters. We know the string starts with "flag" or "FLAG." I noticed that the difference between the second number was 6 more than the first, and l is 6 letters after f. In fact, all four of the first letters follow this pattern.<br><br>So now, we can find all the letters because we know "a" is 21, and all the other letters will be relative to that.<br><br>We have the following y array in the challenge.json:<br>[26, 32, 21, 27, 47, 38, 230, 41, 39, 228, 34, 27, 19, 38, 231, 34, 24, 227, 33, 19, 228, 39, 19, 34, 227, 40, 19, 26, 41, 34, 49, 189]<br><br>Since we know the first four letters are "flag," we can get the following string:<br>flag{r?us?ng?r?nd?m??s?n?t?fun??<br><br>We're seeing that 19 a lot, so we can assume that it's going to be either a space or an underscore, but since this is a flag, probably an underscore:<br>flag{r?us?ng_r?nd?m_?s_n?t_fun??<br><br>Now a lot of the places we don't have yet could be numbers. For example, the "o" in not could be replaced by a "0." If that's true, 227 corresponds to "0" and we can figure out the rest of the numbers:<br>flag{r3us1ng_r4nd0m_1s_n0t_fun??<br><br>An finally, we would think the last character is the bracket, but we want a number next to 47, so 48, the second to last number corresponds to a "}."</p>
