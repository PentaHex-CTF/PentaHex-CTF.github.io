		<p>This problem was an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme in Python. In the end, you could solve this problem without really worrying about that.</p>
		<p>After messing around with the code to try to make it work right, I realized that I didn't have all the shares I need. The program had 20 total shares, we needed 13, and we only had 3. Then, it was time for me to think a bit outside the box. I looked at the function used to split it, in __init__.py. The random number from pick_coefficients() is only ran once, so in all the shares, the same random number is used.<br><br>We did have numbers corresponding to the letters. We know the string starts with "flag" or "FLAG." I noticed that the difference between the second number was 6 more than the first, and l is 6 letters after f. In fact, all four of the first letters follow this pattern.<br><br>So now, we can find all the letters because we know "a" is 21, and all the other letters will be relative to that.<br><br>We have the following y array in the challenge.json:<br>[26, 32, 21, 27, 47, 38, 230, 41, 39, 228, 34, 27, 19, 38, 231, 34, 24, 227, 33, 19, 228, 39, 19, 34, 227, 40, 19, 26, 41, 34, 49, 189]<br><br>Since we know the first four letters are "flag," we can get the following string:<br>flag{r?us?ng?r?nd?m??s?n?t?fun??<br><br>We're seeing that 19 a lot, so we can assume that it's going to be either a space or an underscore, but since this is a flag, probably an underscore:<br>flag{r?us?ng_r?nd?m_?s_n?t_fun??<br><br>Now a lot of the places we don't have yet could be numbers. For example, the "o" in not could be replaced by a "0." If thath's true, 227 corresponds to "0" and we can figure out the rest of the numbers:<br>flag{r3us1ng_r4nd0m_1s_n0t_fun??<br><br>An finally, we would think the last character is the bracket, but we want a number next to 47, so 48, the second to last number corresponds to a "}."</p>
