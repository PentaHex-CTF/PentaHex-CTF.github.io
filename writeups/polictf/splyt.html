			<h2>Splyt (96) - Crypto</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Bob splitted a secret and gave some pieces of it to some of his friends. We managed to convince Eve and Chris to give us their shares.</p>
			<p>We are given a tar <a href='/downloads/writeups/polictf/splyt.tar'>file</a> with the files implementing the split and join functions of the shares.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>This problem was an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme in Python. You could solve this problem without knowing that, though.</p>
			<p>There's a build.sh file with the commands that were run to generate this problem. After messing around with the code to try to make it work right, I realized that the flag was split into 20 parts, and 13 were needed to join it back together. We only have 3. I looked at the split functions, in __init__.py. The pick_coefficients function is only ran once, so there is only one random number generated from the split function, and it's reused in each of the shares.</p>
			<p>In the challenge.json file, there are 3 shares. The array has a number corresponding to each letter in the flag.</p>
			<p>We have the following y array in the challenge.json:<br><div class='code'>[26, 32, 21, 27, 47, 38, 230, 41, 39, 228, 34, 27, 19, 38, 231, 34, 24, 227, 33, 19, 228, 39, 19, 34, 227, 40, 19, 26, 41, 34, 49, 189]</div></p>
			<p>In the end, you don't need to know any of the technical details. We know the string starts with "flag." f=26,l=32,a=21,g=27,{=47</p>
			<p>Now we can figure out all the letters in our flag. a=21,b=22,c=23,...,z=46</p>
			<p>From this, we can get the following string:<br><div class='code'>flag{r?us?ng?r?nd?m??s?n?t?fun??</div></p>
			<p>We're seeing that 19 a lot, so it probably separates the words. Since this is a flag, it's probably an underscore:<br><div class='code'>flag{r?us?ng_r?nd?m_?s_n?t_fun??</div></p>
			<p>A common occurence in flags is to replace the letters with numbers (0=O,1=I,3=E,4=A,5=S,7=T,8=B). Since there are a lot of unknowns in our flag still, they might be numbers representing letters. Near the end of the flag, the n?t is probably "not" with a 0 replacing the o. 0=227,1=228...:<br><div class='code'>flag{r3us1ng_r4nd0m_1s_n0t_fun??</div><p>
			<p>We know {=47, so the } is likely the 49. There's a leftover character, but we don't need to worry about that!</p>
			
			<h3 class='code'>flag{r3us1ng_r4nd0m_1s_n0t_fun}</h3>
